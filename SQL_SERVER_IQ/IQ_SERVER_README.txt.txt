Purpose:
Generate a set of files documenting many aspects of system configuration.

Usage:

Open a command prompt and navigate to the location of the file IQ_SERVER.BAT

The script has no parameters.

To run it, type IQ_SERVER.BAT 

Note: case insensitive

->The script will then run through a set of operating system commands to generate sets of data documenting the system configuration.

->It can take some time to run, typically one minute or less to generate all of the files.

What do I do with all of these files?

The output files can be examned to show that:
 - Software applications are installed
 - Services from installed are configured correctly (and running)
 - User accounts exist
 - Timezone set correctly
 - other items in the output files....
