Purpose
To verify proper installation of Microsoft SQL Server software on a workstation / server.
Technical Approach
Use core Microsoft Operating System functions to examine system directly, without reliance on additional software components.  It is the wmic function that is relied upon extensively.  See MS documentation for information on wmic.
To execute the test, a Windows Batch file is run that makes a series of calls to the wmic functions.  Results from those calls are output to files for examination.
The file IQ_SERVER.bat can be examined to see which functions are being called or to adapt the file.
Acceptance Criteria
The test will demonstrate that:
-	Microsoft SQL Server has been installed
-	Microsoft SQL Server Database Service is configured correctly
-	Microsoft SQL Server ‘master’ database is running
-	Microsoft SQL Server Agent is running
-	Microsoft SQL Server Reporting Service is configured correctly
-	Microsoft SQL Server Integration Service is configured correctly
-	Operating System version is correct
-	Database Timezone is configured correctly
Pre-test Set-up
-	Log into target machine / server
-	Create a folder to hold your testing results e.g. C:\IQ
-	Copy file IQ_SERVER.BAT into the folder e.g. C:\IQ\IQ_SERVER.BAT
-	Navigate to the folder you created e.g. C:\IQ
-	Open a command prompt (Start Menu, enter cmd.exe)
-	Navigate to the location you created e.g. cd C:\IQ

Step	Procedure	Expected Result
Generate a set of data showing the configuration details on the target machine and output those results to files for subsequent examination.
1	Run the command IQ_SERVER.BAT	Script runs, indicates ‘SCRIPT COMPLETED’ and returns to command prompt.
