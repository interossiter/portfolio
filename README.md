<h1>Steve Muller Portfolio</h1>
Place to gather code samples that can be shared.

Every bit of code I've written in my work life is proprietary, owned by a company, and I'm under agreement not to share or present it.

This includes proprietary data analysis algorithms owned by former employers.

This includes proprietary relational database designs owned by former employers.

I will add mostly bioinformatic scripts that perform functions I've found useful.

Most are pretty simple and focused on a single task.

There are some simple bash scripts that are useful for bioinformatics.

<h3>MoonValleyTest</h3>
C++ application I wrote as part of a job interview many years ago.

<h3>SQL_SERVER_IQ</h3>
Useful scripts for generating data that can server as installation qualification (IQ) material for FDA compliance.


<h3>bioinformatics</h3>
Collection of mostly python files that perform data transformations using common bioinformatics tools.
